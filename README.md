## Hi there, I'm Luna Alsalman 👋
welcome to my github account! 

🎓 I'm a Cybersecurity student at Bath Spa University with a passion for keeping data secure and systems robust. I'm fascinated by the world of digital security and constantly learning about the latest threats and defenses.

💻 I have experience with multiple programming languages, including:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS


🔍 I'm always excited to apply my skills in new projects and learn more about the intersections between coding and cybersecurity. Feel free to explore my repositories, where I work on projects that combine coding with cybersecurity principles.

💬 Let's connect! If you want to discuss cybersecurity, coding, or just chat about tech, feel free to reach out.
